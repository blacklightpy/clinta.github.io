If you notice things look a little different here, it's because I've given up on
Jekyll. Ever since github upgraded it I've not been happy with how it does
    syntax highlighting and I've been looking for alternatives.
    [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) looks promising, and that's what I'm trying now.
  Sometime soon I'll blog about my CI setup once it's running the way I like.
